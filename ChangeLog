* commit c6290420cefeef15e7e78d2528a5a1ac452f6973
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Jun 25 11:23:02 2015 -0400
| 
|     Cleaned up some python scripts (still more to do on that front), and edited the Qext calculation in the spheres module; S(theta) had the wrong sign and the calculation of beta wasn't careful when it came to quadrants; this accounts for the odd 'sgnfac' variable that we had before. That has gone away.

* commit 05927183778638e73c48f0271dae886df69c0379
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Tue Jun 9 22:02:03 2015 +0300
| 
|     Mathjax update; documentation now renders math (assuming you're connected to the internetz). Fixed a couple of small inconsistencies -- spherical module now just outputs theta, dQ/dOm instead of the 2d grid (and will do the full grid if you specify --do-full-2d-fft). Theta now runs from 0 to max_angle.

* commit fa6708475017ec77bdf9e5053a1bea2f723db35f
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Mon Jun 8 11:43:31 2015 +0300
| 
|     Major update. FFTW should now be fully operational; uses wisdom and
|     should work with openmp. Configure.ac has been updated so it doesn't
|     crash when you don't have FFTW installed with macports. You can now give
|     configure an argument called macports_prefix=... to specify where
|     macports resides, otherwise it assumes /opt. TODO (I forgot to test
|     this): there might still be a problem when you search for fftw3.f -- it
|     searches in the macports_prefix/local/include directory, but if /opt
|     doesnt exist (because, e.g., the user is on Linux or something), it
|     might crash. The FFTW wisdom implementation for Fortran 95 has been
|     added to f95_wisdom.f90. Added foo.f90, which should test the usability
|     of lfftw3_threads or lfftw3_omp; it doesnt do anything at the
|     moment...Added --quiet and --do-full-2d-fft flags to GGADT (now uses 1d
|     fft speedup by default). --quiet flag suppresses the progress output.
|     Took fft(1d,2d)_firstk out of the fftw/gpfa modules and put them into
|     the common module. TODO: cleanup sphere.f90 and add more documentation.
|     Try to parallelize the section of fftw_firstk that has been giving you
|     so much trouble. Update the documentation (which is ancient by now...)

* commit 5f4b3eddaab31cd883ed8dbdc5fc5c44c4b8bd7d
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Tue Jun 2 22:51:59 2015 -0400
| 
|     MAJOR speed improvement (another order of magnitude). The reason for this will be explained more thoroughly in the documentation, but the main point is that we can avoid doing a 2d FFT altogether by simply averaging the shadow function along one of the axes. This is equivalent to assuming that phi=0, which is WLOG because we're averaging over orientations anyway.
|  
* commit d75a99468fa4e541c2a930636ff842bfa72e1c7a
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Tue Jun 2 15:13:28 2015 -0400
| 
|     Several changes. One, FFT module has been edited and will hopefully soon be close to working. Two, GGADT wasn't ensuring that the grid size was an allowed multiple of 2, 3 and 5 (needed for GPFA); a python script and hidden file have been added containing all of these numbers. GGADT now checks that a specified grid size is OK. Also, commented out the material file specification in the defaults file. Reason being that specifying ephot and ior-re/ior-im throws an error and GGADT would just go to the material file instead of using the ior-im/ior-re values. Also, the conventions for the offset FFTs (the enhancement variable, etc.) was confusing. I cleaned up the language to hopefully make things a bit clearer. Fixed the --use-padded-fft problem -- now completely avoids using fft_firstk function. Also sped up the numerical sphere section of ggadt.f90 by using a linear interpolation of a previously prepared 1-d S(theta). The OpenMP version of the numerical sphere was also wrong; this has been fixed. Added warning when ADT validity conditions are violated, and GGADT will still calculate things for very small grains. There is STILL a bug in the analytical implementation of dQsca/dOmega for spherical grains.

* commit b47c4ff9dc6213ca388d088c5f3ae92efac86f04
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Mon Apr 6 21:54:50 2015 -0400
| 
|     Changed 'for nephot; for norientations' 'for norientations; for nephot' because otherwise you get tons of jitter for non-spherical grains. This needs to be retested. A new bug has been discovered -- the analytic formula for spherical grains appears to be only 1 pct accurate when it should be like 10-3 -- 10-4; a problem for another commit
|  
* commit 7ae21bdda23e67da4221e35134cfd514f88e52db
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Aug 28 20:21:42 2014 -0400
| 
|     Added a working 'rotation_matrix' function that avoids doing matrix products. Have not tested it with 2d scattering function to see if the wierd streaks are present as was the problem with the original function. ALSO added an improved way to do calculations for ellipsoidal grains (much faster; not sure how much faster...). This removes the rotation matrix parameter for the ellipsoidal function calls, and for each orientation does the bulk of the number crunching ONE time, and stores 4 constants for future use for that orientation. This means that an additional function call 'set_constants' is needed after each orientation change.

| 
|     Fixed bug in sphere.f90, where ABS(rho1) was used instead of the correct 'rho1', leading to sign errors in the efficiencies.
|  
* commit 2817e39e49d81bcf4b81a148fa569cea744d6c09
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Aug 21 18:45:34 2014 -0400
| 
|     Edited sphere.f90 module to reflect a discovered mistake in equation (16) (extinction efficiency for spheres) from Draine & Allaf-Akbari 2006. When Re(m-1) > 0, the old expression produced physically implausible results (i.e., negative efficiencies, efficiencies greater than 2). By changing the sign of |rho|sin(Re(rho) - beta) when Re(m-1) > 0, the result is consistent with Mie theory. Derivations of the correct formula are in progress.

| 
|     Modified sphere.f90 to be consistent with Bruce Draine's 'adt.f' code. Catches a zero-valued real component of m-1, and uses an approximation for when rho << 1.

* commit af616709c2ce95a19b88e65f2e69418f90d691a0
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Sun Jun 22 20:57:10 2014 -0400
| 
|     Hopefully resolved conflicts between parameterfiles/default files/command line input. A 'rank' attribute was added to the options datatype in the options module. The selected value for a parameter is chosen from the (1) command line (2) specified parameter file (3) default file (4) hard-coded default value. Some additional checks to the parameter reading section of the code were added. Still needs to be robustly tested to make sure the parameter selection works the way it is supposed to and that all conflicts are resolved appropriately.

* commit f2bd344e93fcd1ab9e8846a5fa2167c784c5c1e0
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu May 29 18:15:58 2014 -0400
| 
|     Added default file. Added a markdown version of the README.md file (which is identical to the README file; both are kept so that the autoconf scripts don't complain. GNU compatible software has to have a file called 'README' in the parent directory. The options script also depends on the read(access=stream) command in Fortran, and this is NOT (I don't think) in the F95 standard. The configure.ac script should check that the fortran compiler can deal with this, otherwise they won't be able to use parameter files. Also added the grain-geometry=agglomerate option, but also kept the grain-geometry=spheres option as well.

* commit 59e9cfd153f82e38b4073c8f2dab8a45e5e65f82
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Tue May 27 18:10:41 2014 -0400
| 
|     Fixed the bug in the analytic calculation of the differential scattering cross section (for a spherical grain). This still needs to be validated (there might still be significant differences between the analytical and numerical expressions) against Mie theory. The fudge factors are the 'nu_sphere' parameter defined in constants.f90.in, and the number of thetas for which to interpolate S(theta). Right now we use 10*size(thetax), but changing this might produce a few percent difference... Also changed 'sed' flag to 'integrated' flag. I think 'integrated' makes more sense than 'sed' for telling GGADT you want to calculate the integrated scattering/absorption cross sections. GGADT ALSO now outputs sigma_ext in addition to sigma_scat and sigma_abs.

| 
|     Fixed a bug which was caused when using material-file and not material-file1,2,etc. One subroutine was using the wrong array of indices of refraction (the array it was using was uninitialized), so ggadt printed gibberish. Problem should be fixed now.

| |       Merge branch 'hoffman'
| |       ...I'm not sure why I'm being asked to explain myself. The merge should just add the changes that were in the hoffman branch on my local machine. Changes include fixing the OpenMP version of the SED mode, and adding some documentation.

| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Mon Mar 17 16:49:51 2014 -0500
| 
|     progress towards a working SED module. Code is UNTESTED and only takes custom material files. (made a sample one: data/silicate.mat). No option to have mixed composition agglomerates. Made a new subroutine in the spheres module to rotate the spheres. The ellipsoid module does not have this, and maybe it's a good idea to make one for consistency.

| Date:   Fri Mar 14 01:57:27 2014 -0400
| 
|     Fixed compile-time bugs in gpfamod/common stemming from 'use common' in gpfa (which then uses gpfa), and using c_double_complex where kind=dp_complex should have been used.

* commit 378a7b440e14069deea4dbc3b2f9a620a0558814
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Fri Mar 14 01:38:22 2014 -0400
| 
|     Added scripts to quantify accuracy vs choice in nscatter, ngrain and norientations. Edited documentation. Began adding some declarations and code for SED mode. Did timing tests for padded vs. unpadded FFTs. FFTW is slower than before, since we avoid working with wisdom at the moment. Added common FFT methods to common_mod. Added default declarations to constants.f95.

* commit 8c2e162a745dbdabd721ac25c3eea6d98b64d2c7
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Sun Mar 9 19:53:33 2014 -0400
| 
|     Tried to revert to f95, and it seems the only problem (except fftw3 problems) is the options module. We might have to replace that if we want to increase compatibility, but that will be annoying. The buggy behavior that occured when ngrain was too small to provide k out to kmax (i.e. when max-scattering-angle was too large compared to ngrain) has been addressed. GGADT prints an error, and the minimum ngrain value needed.
|  
* commit 2febc2bcf9c64f6a3f40308fe652ba5a38e78ee4
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Mar 6 14:42:36 2014 -0500
| 
|     GPFA now compatible with experimental fft. Edited documentation to reflect new command line arguments. Documentation still needs extensive revision and additional information. Sample scripts need to be consistent with what's in the current directory.
|  
* commit 31926b9eb9c75fb92cd4af090328f8d549921ee1
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Mar 6 14:15:34 2014 -0500
| 
|     Edited plot_utilities to give correct shape for get_1d_slice function. Tested that the indexing shortcut in phi_spheres works correctly. Tested results for spheres module doing single sphere (by eye). HD09 is still not consistent with what we're getting at large angles, even after using a very fine grid for nscatter and ngrid.
|  
* commit 4d152f85ae9ab32f91e812fe3964bc8bc8ada11d
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Wed Mar 5 22:41:29 2014 -0500
| 
|     All modules are stable and can do arbitrary Nscatter. The instabilities before were a result of not initializing arrays to 0. Heng and Draine status: The peak and low angle behavior is fine. However, there is no large angle theta-squared falloff. The origin of this needs to be found! HD09.py and DA06.py are both compatible with current changes.
|  
* commit e22e799b0cf0ffe5de9dc61e624575076b1c0a31
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Wed Feb 26 10:45:56 2014 -0500
| 
|     Now integrated a more efficient way to do the FFT. Still investigating the costs in accuracy. The new FFT only works with FFTW at the moment. Input options have changed: -nangle is now -norientations, -ngrid has split into -ngrain and -nscatter. I've written test-changes.sh which should run cases for spheres, sphere, ellipsoid for both experimental fft and the old fft with padding. I also added an additional module called 'constants.f03' which should contain things like pi, twopi, etc. SPHERES MODULE IS CURRENTLY INOPERABLE (outputs mostly NaN values)

* commit 1623a3d6cd8242a00d4394acd30e4eb86b9cd0a4
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Mon Feb 17 17:26:14 2014 -0500
| 
|     OK, experimental fft 'works,' but in some cases produces very high power at the bottom left corner of the plot. Also, the 'center' function appears not to work (or the theta values are off) for the regular fft.

* commit 5e3352cf2eb03ca888aa243c2bcffa9618ebd0b3
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Feb 6 00:58:18 2014 -0500
| 
|     Several changes: spheres, ellipsoid and sphere module no longer include common_mod, and the functions in these modules (phi, shadow, etc) require more arguments. The spheres module divided radii by 2 (not sure why), and that's now been changed. I have only been compiling the serial version, with fftw3. The openmp version should be tested, and the pragma calls will likely need to be adjusted. GGADT now reproduces Draine and Allaf-Akbari 2006 (spheres and ellipsoids), and this commit contains a complete rewrite of all scripts. DA06.py reproduces figures 1 and 2 in DA06. HD09.py at the moment tries to reproduce figure 3 in Heng and Draine 2009, but UNSUCCESSFULLY (see HD09_f3.png in the data dir). ALSO: change in command line arguments: RE-index-of-refraction is now ior_re (same for IM-index-of-refraction --> ior_im). And some other changes in the variable names to be more consistent throughout the code. paramfiles directory is now parameter-files directory. TODO: clean up, fix HD09 bugs with the spheres module(?), add fast FFT for both fftw3 and gpfa modules, revert everything back to F90/95, etc

* commit 0c4c81ee8a61ec2c5511ec091b43d1b9c74c1980
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Tue Feb 4 13:59:03 2014 -0500
| 
|     Bug discovered when trying to reproduce figure 1 of DA06. E=0.5, a=0.1. The central peak is too high by over an order of magnitude, and the location of the minima are at roughly half the angle they should be. More progress on DA06.py

* commit 164281f8ad34166ba482af5544da61e26a4ae6ca
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Tue Feb 4 10:46:52 2014 -0500
| 
|     Progress on experimental fft (only fftw3). Cannot currently get fftw_plan_many_dft to do what I want it to do. Also ggadt can now accept a list of orientations in a file (euler-angle-mode=file euler-angle-file=/file/path). Started DA06.py for reproducing DA06 plots. Need to start another python script that compares accuracy of different ngrid, nangle and boxwidth combos.
|  
* commit a5af0ba55ef01f3ec336caa97dfe299162e3483a
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Jan 30 22:40:54 2014 -0500
| 
|     Rudimentary timing script made and timing results in doc/ dir. These figures need to be put into the documentation. FFTW3 is approx. 20-30% better than GPFA for large grid sizes. Added --timing flag to suppress output from ggadt, and deleted the output from FFTW (why would users care? They can modify fftwmod.f03 to output things as they see fit).

* commit 8fb35f5fd6b5d64085bb77c725640428faec6b23

* commit eaf1c4df61aebaa30bf3830ac9d646b230e162d3
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Wed Jan 29 17:57:40 2014 -0500
| 
|     Used calls in cxf...f90 to figure out how to use GPFA correctly. Now ggadt mysteriously segfaults, and I cannot find where this happens, since the segfault occurs after the cleanup() command. I'm trying to get gdb working to figure out the problem.
|  
* commit 4836d1e6692245db7063fc22736b6668b37617bb
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Tue Jan 28 19:20:32 2014 -0500
| 
|     Now conditionally uses either gpfa or fftw. You have to --enable-fftw to use it. GPFA DOES NOT currently work; segfaulting. I dont understand the meaning of the JUMP and INC parameters.

* commit ac1a16fe99e50a7b4e34fb98765d9fbf82e5f9a6
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Tue Jan 28 11:39:43 2014 -0500
| 
|     Combined OMP and serial. Spheres module now reads in all parts of header (can't remember if I did that in this commit or last commit...). Fixed problems with command line/parameter file parsing. Autoconf now erases HOME/.ggadt on uninstall and clean. Should probably change this to work with the GNU standard datadir variable in the future.

| | Date:   Mon Jan 13 17:10:31 2014 -0600
| | 
| |     Fixed problems with OpenMP support. Autoconf should recognize openmp and fftw3_omp operability and compile accordingly. Tarczon might have problems if we installed fftw3 with --enable-single or --enable-float.
| |

| | 
| |     Some more changes to directory structure, but now autoconf allows you to turn on/off openmp. IGNORE MPI for now. It appears there are no viable MPI compilers that will work with Fortran 2003. Strange.

| |     Autoconf now seems to work OK. Set up directory and file structure to make openmp and mpi versions of the program. I still need to add the correct library linking flags to the two parallel versions of the program.

| 
|     Divided into modules, spherical module generates results consistent with D&AA2006. For now, params.f03 contains relevant parameters which are hardcoded into GGADT at compile time. This should be changed to allow for a user to select between parameter files or specify parameters as command line arguments.
