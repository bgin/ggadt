* commit 08d48078c2d39205c9cc907483bed36cd1029ba4
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Sun Mar 23 09:54:30 2014 -0500
| 
|     Tested ellipsoid, sphere and spheres module against mie theory, all is well (had abs and scat switched in the code somewhere). OpenMP mode is BROKEN. Does not produce sensible results (lots of stochasticity). Need to find fix. Mie theory python script added.

* commit 75aa5bc5a0ab88b70cb746e379e73abf4392da53
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Fri Mar 21 21:02:32 2014 -0500
| 
|     added cluster files. OpenMP works. Wrote several python scripts to test the sed of absorption/scattering cross sections. Absorption efficiency DECREASES with porosity. The opposite should happen.

* commit dca5b289ba3a1eafdea27c10761210a64f436f89
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Mon Mar 17 16:49:51 2014 -0500
| 
|     progress towards a working SED module. Code is UNTESTED and only takes custom material files. (made a sample one: data/silicate.mat). No option to have mixed composition agglomerates. Made a new subroutine in the spheres module to rotate the spheres. The ellipsoid module does not have this, and maybe it's a good idea to make one for consistency.

* commit 10a6c1d742953493408f3a28cef61993e5a28b2d
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Fri Mar 14 01:57:27 2014 -0400
| 
|     Fixed compile-time bugs in gpfamod/common stemming from 'use common' in gpfa (which then uses gpfa), and using c_double_complex where kind=dp_complex should have been used.
|  
* commit 0f9053075c12d87fb8e709de9ab842e349025092
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Fri Mar 14 01:38:22 2014 -0400
| 
|     Added scripts to quantify accuracy vs choice in nscatter, ngrain and norientations. Edited documentation. Began adding some declarations and code for SED mode. Did timing tests for padded vs. unpadded FFTs. FFTW is slower than before, since we avoid working with wisdom at the moment. Added common FFT methods to common_mod. Added default declarations to constants.f95.

* commit 8924d76c9eada96cb03d5c5d6738b1753c9e834a
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Sun Mar 9 19:53:33 2014 -0400
| 
|     Tried to revert to f95, and it seems the only problem (except fftw3 problems) is the options module. We might have to replace that if we want to increase compatibility, but that will be annoying. The buggy behavior that occured when ngrain was too small to provide k out to kmax (i.e. when max-scattering-angle was too large compared to ngrain) has been addressed. GGADT prints an error, and the minimum ngrain value needed.

* commit 5bd19422edc9cde6fee7401370591436acb2eddd
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Mar 6 14:42:36 2014 -0500
| 
|     GPFA now compatible with experimental fft. Edited documentation to reflect new command line arguments. Documentation still needs extensive revision and additional information. Sample scripts need to be consistent with what's in the current directory.
|  
* commit dec9746fa1deec5bd865b683648541f69480807a
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Mar 6 14:15:34 2014 -0500
| 
|     Edited plot_utilities to give correct shape for get_1d_slice function. Tested that the indexing shortcut in phi_spheres works correctly. Tested results for spheres module doing single sphere (by eye). HD09 is still not consistent with what we're getting at large angles, even after using a very fine grid for nscatter and ngrid.
|  
* commit cee6238b4d0492065e0f2f9dc6bd03fcb6aa3682
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Wed Mar 5 22:41:29 2014 -0500
| 
|     All modules are stable and can do arbitrary Nscatter. The instabilities before were a result of not initializing arrays to 0. Heng and Draine status: The peak and low angle behavior is fine. However, there is no large angle theta-squared falloff. The origin of this needs to be found! HD09.py and DA06.py are both compatible with current changes.

* commit b7c8907be51eeac933198eeaa93725b37d020bd2
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Wed Feb 26 10:45:56 2014 -0500
| 
|     Now integrated a more efficient way to do the FFT. Still investigating the costs in accuracy. The new FFT only works with FFTW at the moment. Input options have changed: -nangle is now -norientations, -ngrid has split into -ngrain and -nscatter. I've written test-changes.sh which should run cases for spheres, sphere, ellipsoid for both experimental fft and the old fft with padding. I also added an additional module called 'constants.f03' which should contain things like pi, twopi, etc. SPHERES MODULE IS CURRENTLY INOPERABLE (outputs mostly NaN values)

* commit c2f03c65e8f5766789ec020a1e20ef0d8497b641
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Mon Feb 17 17:26:14 2014 -0500
| 
|     OK, experimental fft 'works,' but in some cases produces very high power at the bottom left corner of the plot. Also, the 'center' function appears not to work (or the theta values are off) for the regular fft.

* commit 79e197026d9c336ed08a54d5b41c918c042161cb
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Feb 6 00:58:18 2014 -0500
| 
|     Several changes: spheres, ellipsoid and sphere module no longer include common_mod, and the functions in these modules (phi, shadow, etc) require more arguments. The spheres module divided radii by 2 (not sure why), and that's now been changed. I have only been compiling the serial version, with fftw3. The openmp version should be tested, and the pragma calls will likely need to be adjusted. GGADT now reproduces Draine and Allaf-Akbari 2006 (spheres and ellipsoids), and this commit contains a complete rewrite of all scripts. DA06.py reproduces figures 1 and 2 in DA06. HD09.py at the moment tries to reproduce figure 3 in Heng and Draine 2009, but UNSUCCESSFULLY (see HD09_f3.png in the data dir). ALSO: change in command line arguments: RE-index-of-refraction is now ior_re (same for IM-index-of-refraction --> ior_im). And some other changes in the variable names to be more consistent throughout the code. paramfiles directory is now parameter-files directory. TODO: clean up, fix HD09 bugs with the spheres module(?), add fast FFT for both fftw3 and gpfa modules, revert everything back to F90/95, etc

| 
|     Bug discovered when trying to reproduce figure 1 of DA06. E=0.5, a=0.1. The central peak is too high by over an order of magnitude, and the location of the minima are at roughly half the angle they should be. More progress on DA06.py

| Date:   Tue Feb 4 10:46:52 2014 -0500
| 
|     Progress on experimental fft (only fftw3). Cannot currently get fftw_plan_many_dft to do what I want it to do. Also ggadt can now accept a list of orientations in a file (euler-angle-mode=file euler-angle-file=/file/path). Started DA06.py for reproducing DA06 plots. Need to start another python script that compares accuracy of different ngrid, nangle and boxwidth combos.

* commit 5b861ca9a425c75e9cd60451a5b5534e05639e0f
| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Thu Jan 30 22:40:54 2014 -0500
| 
|     Rudimentary timing script made and timing results in doc/ dir. These figures need to be put into the documentation. FFTW3 is approx. 20-30% better than GPFA for large grid sizes. Added --timing flag to suppress output from ggadt, and deleted the output from FFTW (why would users care? They can modify fftwmod.f03 to output things as they see fit).

| Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| Date:   Wed Jan 29 17:57:40 2014 -0500
| 
|     Used calls in cxf...f90 to figure out how to use GPFA correctly. Now ggadt mysteriously segfaults, and I cannot find where this happens, since the segfault occurs after the cleanup() command. I'm trying to get gdb working to figure out the problem.

| 
|     Now conditionally uses either gpfa or fftw. You have to --enable-fftw to use it. GPFA DOES NOT currently work; segfaulting. I dont understand the meaning of the JUMP and INC parameters.

| 
|     Combined OMP and serial. Spheres module now reads in all parts of header (can't remember if I did that in this commit or last commit...). Fixed problems with command line/parameter file parsing. Autoconf now erases HOME/.ggadt on uninstall and clean. Should probably change this to work with the GNU standard datadir variable in the future.

| | Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| | Date:   Tue Jan 14 14:46:36 2014 -0600
| | 
| |     Added more documentation, added version option in common.f03, made common.f03 --> common.f03.in so we can automatically update the version in the source code, switched around the help output to make it more readable.

| | 
| |     FFTW plan directory is now set in the makefiles. We should alert the user that they will have to remove HOME/.ggadt manually, since I cant find a way to add that to the make uninstall option.

| | | 
| | |     Shortened one of the lines in fftw-mod (both omp and serial). Why do I have to do this if we are using F2003??

| | Date:   Mon Jan 13 20:01:11 2014 -0600
| | 
| |     Made autoconf require 2.63 instead of 2.68, and added more tests for fortran and changed the plan directory to HOME/.ggadt/plans

* | commit 6b64532dc72b89c094ae677c80d4a1ec61cb2c22
| | Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| | Date:   Mon Jan 13 17:10:31 2014 -0600
| | 
| |     Fixed problems with OpenMP support. Autoconf should recognize openmp and fftw3_omp operability and compile accordingly. Tarczon might have problems if we installed fftw3 with --enable-single or --enable-float.
| |   
* | commit 3e6cc66f7952565f765ee1eda4878ed71b493890

| | Date:   Sun Jan 12 18:19:25 2014 -0600
| | 
| |     Some more changes to directory structure, but now autoconf allows you to turn on/off openmp. IGNORE MPI for now. It appears there are no viable MPI compilers that will work with Fortran 2003. Strange.
| |   
| * commit cb5f90be062d3febcaad8479dd78a3cde0b13922
| | Author: John Hoffman <jah5@princeton.edu>
| | Date:   Sun Jan 12 15:33:08 2014 -0600
| | 
| |     Autoconf now seems to work OK. Set up directory and file structure to make openmp and mpi versions of the program. I still need to add the correct library linking flags to the two parallel versions of the program.

| 
|     Divided into modules, spherical module generates results consistent with D&AA2006. For now, params.f03 contains relevant parameters which are hardcoded into GGADT at compile time. This should be changed to allow for a user to select between parameter files or specify parameters as command line arguments.
