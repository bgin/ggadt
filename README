GGADT version 0.9.0 -- Jan 14, 2014
Authors: John Hoffman, Michael Tarczon


GGADT calculates the x-ray scattering properties of dust
in the interstellar medium. You define the geometry and composition
of a dust grain, the energy of the incident x-ray photons, and a few other parameters. 
GGADT then calculates the orientationally-averaged scattering 
cross-section in the plane perpendicular to the incident photons.
