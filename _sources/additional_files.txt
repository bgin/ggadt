Additional files
================

To keep GGADT lean, we opted not to include target files and index files (except for those in the ``example`` directory). You can download tarballs of both index files and a complete list of target files pulled from http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~draine/agglom.html .

* `Index files <index_files.tar.gz>`_ (328 Kb)
* `Target files <target_files.tar.gz>`_ (6.6 Mb)
