.. glossary ::

	material tags
		Shortname that refers to a particular index file.

	optically thin
		Optically thin refers to materials with an index of refraction very close to 1. :math:`|m-1| \ll 1`

	wavenumber
		The wavenumber is defined to be
		
		.. math ::

			k\equiv\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}

		where :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength of the light.

	effective radius
		The effective radius of a grain is the radius of a (uniform-density) sphere that has the same mass as that grain:

		.. math::

			a_{\rm eff}\equiv (3V/4\pi)^{1/3}

	index file
		The index file refers to a text file containing the index of refraction and 
		dielectric function for a given material and for a given number of energies. It must
		be formatted in a particular way (see :option:`--material-file`)

	differential scattering cross section
		Defined to be

			.. math::

				\frac{dC_{\rm sca}}{d\Omega}

	arcseconds
		An arcsecond is 1/60 :superscript:`th` of an arcminute, which in turn is 1/60 :superscript:`th` of a degree.

	monomers
		Grains such as BA, BAM1, and BAM2 grains are composed of many spherical particles, called *monomers*.
