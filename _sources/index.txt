:program:`GGADT` is short for General Geometry Anomalous Diffraction Theory. It is a Fortran 90 program that uses :abbr:`ADT (Anomalous Diffraction Theory)` (see [VDH1957]_) to compute the differential scattering cross section (or the total cross sections as a function of energy) for a specified grain. ADT is valid when

.. math::

	|m-1| \ll 1

(i.e. when the grain is :index:`optically thin`), and when

.. math::

	ka \gg 1

here :math:`k` is the :index:`wavenumber` of the incident photons and :math:`a` is the :index:`effective radius` of the grain, defined to be

.. math::
	
	a \equiv \left(\frac{3V}{4\pi}\right)^{1/3}
