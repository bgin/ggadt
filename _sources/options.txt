Arguments and parameters
========================

GGADT supports the following options:

General options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. option:: --help, -h
	
	The "help" screen–prints usage information and available options.

.. option:: --version, -v
	
	Print the version number of GGADT on standard output and then exit successfully.

.. option:: --verbose, -d
	
	Be extra loud (useful for debugging)

.. option:: --quiet, -q
	
	Do not print progress. GGADT by default will print out a percent complete: XX.X% statement during runtime; this option suppresses that.

.. option:: --timing, -t
	
	Do not output data. No I/O is useful if you care about measuring the runtime of GGADT.

.. option:: --nthreads=value

	You can set the number of threads (for OpenMP); GGADT executes ``call omp_set_num_threads(nthreads)``

.. option:: --use-padded-fft, -s
	
	This will force GGADT to do only one FFT. In order to provide you with the desired angular resolution of the differential cross section (set by nscatter), GGADT will pad the 2-d grid on which the shadow function is defined. Forcing GGADT to use a padded FFT, instead of the more efficient method without padding, will run much slower.

.. option:: --force-numerical
	
	This will force GGADT to use a numerical calculation of the differential scattering cross section for spherical grains (an analytical Anomalous Diffraction Theory solution is implemented by default).

.. option:: --do-full-2d-fft
	
	Do not utilize the fact that you can make a 2d FFT a 1d FFT if you only care about the orientationally averaged value of dσ/dΩ(θ)

.. option:: --save-shadow-function
	
	You can save a copy of the 2d shadow function of your grain (useful as a sanity check or to make pretty pictures)

.. option:: --save-file-root=value

	The "root" filename that the shadow function is saved to; for each orientation, GGADT saves the shadow function to::

		[file_root]_shadow_function_o[00001, 00002, ..., N].dat

.. option:: --parameter-file=value
	
	Path to a correctly formatted parameter file.

.. option:: --grain-geometry=value
	
	Geometry of dust grain. Must be one of SPHERE, ELLIPSOID, CUSTOM, SPHERES (or equivalently, AGGLOMERATION). A SPHERES grain geometry means that your grain is a conglomerate of smaller spheres. If you wish to use this grain geometry, you should supply a file (hereafter called a “agglomeration file", see the next option) that defines the relative positions of the spheres that make up the grain. The sizes of these spheres will be normalized so that the effective radius of the grain is consistent with aeff.

.. option:: --aeff=value
	
	Effective radius of dust grain. The effective radius is defined to be the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the dust grain.

.. option:: --ngrain=value

	The (square root) of the number of grid elements with which you would like to resolve your grain. To get accurate results out to about 4000 arcseconds, we’ve found that a value of 64 is good enough.

.. option:: --norientations=value
	
	The number of grain orientations relative to the incoming X-ray photon over which to average the differential cross-section.

.. option:: --grid-width=value
	
	You can manually set the length of the grid (in microns) with this argument.

.. option:: --axes-convention=value
	
	The axes convention to use. Must be one of DDSCAT or MSTM. These conventions are explained later in the documentation.

.. option:: --fftw-optimization=value
	
	Must be one of ESTIMATE, MEASURE, PATIENT or EXHAUSTIVE. For more information about what these tags mean and about FFTW wisdom, see http://fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Words-of-Wisdom_002dSaving-Plans.html#Words-of-Wisdom_002dSaving-Plans.

.. option:: --angle-mode=value
	
	Must be one of random, sequential, or file. Specifying random will average over norientations grain orientations, with each angle chosen from a uniform distribution over the domain of orientation angles. Specifying sequential will make GGADT use a set of angles that are evenly spaced over each of the orientation angle domains. Specifying file allows you to give GGADT specific orientation angles to use in orientational averaging. The file mode requires that you also specify --angle-file=/path/to/angle-file which contains a list of orientation angles.

.. option:: --angle-file=value
	
	Path to a file containing a list of orientation angles which GGADT will use to compute orientational averages. Only used when --angle-mode=file.

.. option:: --material-file=value
	
	Path to file defining the energy-dependent index of refraction and dielectric constant for the grain material you would like to use. The material files must be formatted in the way that GGADT expects, namely with a two-line header,::

		17 =ICOMP: amorphous olivine-like astrosilicate
    		E(eV)      Re(n)-1    Im(n)    Re(eps)-1  Im(eps)
	
	followed by data for the material::

		1.000000E-05  2.435E+00 1.119E-03  1.080E+01 7.688E-03
		1.240000E-05  2.435E+00 1.388E-03  1.080E+01 9.534E-03
		1.771000E-05  2.435E+00 1.982E-03  1.080E+01 1.362E-02
		2.000000E-05  2.435E+00 2.239E-03  1.080E+01 1.538E-02
		...

Ellipsoidal grains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. option:: --grain-axis-x=value
	
	For ELLIPSOID grains, we define the lengths of x, y and z axes.

.. option:: --grain-axis-y=value
.. option:: --grain-axis-z=value

Agglomerations of spherical particles (single or multiple composition)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. option:: --agglom-file=value
	
	Path to a correctly formatted agglomeration file. Several agglomeration files are included with the distribution (see data/agglomerations), and if you wish to create your own, you must mimic exactly the format of these files.

.. option:: --material-file1=value, --material-file2=value, --material-filen=value
	
	Path(s) to the index file for material 1, 2, 3, etc.

.. option:: --material-tag1=value, --material-tag2=value, --material-tagn=value
	
	The name(s) by which material 1, 2, 3, etc. are referred to in the agglomerate composition file.

.. option:: --agglom-composition-file=value
	
	Provides the path to a text file that lists the spherical agglomerates and a material ’tag’ which is associated with an index file.

	The agglomerate composition file is assumed to be formatted with one header line, followed by as many lines as there are agglomerates in the grain, with each line containing the index of an agglomerate and a material 'tag'::

		j      material tag
		1    silicate
		2    silicate
		3    iron
		4    silicate
		...

Differential scattering cross section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. option:: --nscatter=value
	
	The (square root) of the number of grid elements (in theta) with which you would like to resolve the differential scattering cross section.

.. option:: --dtheta=value
	
	Alternate to --nscatter: this defines the spacing of the scattering angles (in arcseconds) that you would like to calculate the differential cross section.

.. option:: --ephot=value
	
	Energy of the incident X-ray photon in keV.

.. option:: --ior-re=value, --ior-im=value
	
	The real and imaginary components of the complex index of refraction, minus one. If --material-file is specified, these parameters are overwritten by the linearly interpolated value of the index of refraction at E = ephot.

.. option:: --max-angle=value
	
	The maximum scattering angle for which you would like to calculate the differential scattering cross section.

.. option:: --do-phi-averaging
	
	If ``--do-full-2d-fft`` is set, you have the option of also setting ``--do-phi-averaging``, which averages the resulting :math:`dC_{\rm sca}/d\Omega(\theta,\phi)` over :math:`\phi` at each orientation, giving you a 1d result. In certain cases (i.e. for ``custom`` geometries), this is faster than doing many 1d FFT's.

.. option:: --nphi=value
	
	When ``--do-phi-averaging`` is set, you can set the number of :math:`\phi` values over which you average the 2d differential scattering cross section.

Energy-dependent scattering and absorption cross sections (integrated mode)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You must also define a ``--material-file`` to do this calculation.

.. option:: --integrated
	
	This flag tells GGADT that you would like to calculate the energy-dependent integrated absorption and scattering cross sections.

.. option:: --nephots=value
	
	Defines the number of photon energies to calculate the cross sections between --ephot-min and --ephot-max. You can also define the energy spacing directly, via the --dephot parameter.

.. option:: --dephot=value
	
	Alternate to --nephots, defines the energy spacing between different photon energies for which the cross sections are calculated.

.. option:: --ephot-min=value
	
	Defines the minimum photon energy for which the cross sections are calculated

.. option:: --ephot-max=value
	
	Defines the maximum photon energy for which the cross sections are calculated

Default parameter values
------------------------

Default parameter values are loaded from the ``.defaults`` file located in the parent directory of GGADT. You can edit this file, or (as a safer option), edit a copy of this file and pass the path as the value for ``--parameter-file``.
